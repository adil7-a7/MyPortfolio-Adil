# Portfolio Website - Adil Seco

## Overview
As part of the weekly challenge of the Front-End Development Bootcamp I developed a website design for my portfolio.


## User Acceptance Criteria
* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

## Brand Colors
 I have used a combination of blue and black.

 I chose the following colors for my portolfio because:
 Blue:  evokes the emotion of trust, reliability at a subconsious level.
 Black: evokes and associates with prestige, and premium.
